@article{Yildirim2016,
abstract = {Linguistic meaning has long been recognized to be highly context-dependent. Quantifiers like many and some provide a particularly clear example of context-dependence. For example, the interpretation of quantifiers requires listeners to determine the relevant domain and scale. We focus on another type of context-dependence that quantifiers share with other lexical items: talker variability. Different talkers might use quantifiers with different interpretations in mind. We used a web-based crowdsourcing paradigm to study participants' expectations about the use of many and some based on recent exposure. We first established that the mapping of some and many onto quantities (candies in a bowl) is variable both within and between participants. We then examined whether and how listeners' expectations about quantifier use adapts with exposure to talkers who use quantifiers in different ways. The results demonstrate that listeners can adapt to talker-specific biases in both how often and with what intended meaning many and some are used.},

abstract = {To examine the relationship between syntactic processes in language comprehension and language production, we compared structural persistence from sentence primes that speakers heard to persistence from primes that speakers produced. [Bock, J. K., {\&} Griffin, Z. M. (2000). The persistence of structural priming: transient activation or implicit learning? Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 129, 177-192.] showed that the production of target priming structures increased the probability of spontaneously using the same structures to describe events in subsequent pictures that were semantically unrelated to the primes. These priming effects persisted across as many as ten intervening filler trials. The present studies replicated these results using auditorily presented primes to which participants only listened. The results indicated persistence of priming across all lags, with relative magnitudes of priming as large as those observed by Bock and Griffin. The implication is that structural priming is persistent regardless of the modality in which language structures are experienced, underscoring the power of priming as an implicit learning mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Two studies were run to determine whether the interpretations of statements or forecasts using vague probability and frequency expressions such as likely, improbable, frequently, or rarely, were sensitive to the base rates of the events involved. In the first experiment, professional weather forecasters judged event probabilities in situations drawn from a medical context. In the second experiment, students judged matched forecast scenarios of common semantic content that differed only in prior probability (as determined by an independent group of subjects). Results were (a) the interpretations of forecasts using neutral (e.g., possible) and high probability or frequency terms (e.g., usually) were strong, positive functions of base rate, while the interpretations of forecasts using low terms (e.g., rarely) were much less affected by base rates; (b) in the second experiment interpretations of forecasts appeared to represent some kind of average of the meaning of the expression and the base rate. {\textcopyright} 1986.},
